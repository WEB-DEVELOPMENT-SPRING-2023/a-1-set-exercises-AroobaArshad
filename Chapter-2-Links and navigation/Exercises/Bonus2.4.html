            <h2>Characters</h2>
            <h3>Avatar Aang</h3>
            <p>
                Avatar Aang is the protagonist of the original series and the current Avatar, a cyclically reincarnating being who maintains world balance. 
                Aang often acts in a fun-loving, carefree manner. His pacifism and vegetarianism are primary traits of Buddhism. The creators intended Aang to "defeat enemies with his wits" and be a "trickster hero". Though Aang is often frivolous and enthusiastic, he becomes serious during a crisis.
                <br><br>In the original series, Katara and Sokka rescue Aang from a century of suspended animation due to being frozen in an iceberg. Having already mastered his native Airbending, Aang learns Waterbending from Katara and later Pakku at the North Pole in Book One, Earthbending from Toph in Book Two, and Firebending from Zuko in Book Three. Throughout the series, Aang aids the Water Tribes and the Earth Kingdom, whom the Fire Nation has oppressed.
            </p>
            <h3>Appa</h3>
            <p>
                Appa is Aang's male flying bison, animal guide and spirit companion. He is Aang's best friend and serves as the group's mode of transport around the world. He can fly and can use his tail to create powerful gusts of air. According to Aang, flying bisons were the first Airbenders. The show's creators, Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, have described Appa's appearance as a cross between a bison and a manatee. He is known to shed his coat at the end of winter.
            </p>
            <h3>Katara</h3>
            <p>
                Katara is a 14 year-old Waterbending master from the Southern Water Tribe, best friend and later wife of Avatar Aang, and Sokkaâ€™s younger sister. In the original series, Katara is known to be very caring and compassionate while also having a strong determination to stand up against systems of oppression and injustice. While she may have been a relatively inexperienced Waterbender at the start of the series, by the end of Book One Katara manages to claim the title of "Waterbending Master" surpassing the skillset of Avatar Aang.
                <br><br>Having left the Northern Water Tribe at the beginning of Book Two Katara continues to train Aang's as his teacher. In addition to healing, Katara's abilities as a Waterbender range from temperature control, using streams of water to grab onto people and platforms, being able to manipulate the water in clouds, creating pockets of air in large bodies of water, being able to pull water from the air and plants, and the ability to control the water inside another living organism also known as Bloodbending.
            </p>
            <h3>Sokka</h3>
            <p>
                Sokka is a 15-year-old warrior of the Southern Water Tribe, and Katara's older brother. With no bending power of his own, Sokka relies largely on a metallic boomerang, a blunt metal club, a machete, and later a black jian, or sword, created from the metals of a meteorite.
                 Surprisingly in an inhabitant of a mystical world, Sokka is an engineer and something of a jack-of-all-trades, in which respect he is easily able to understand the Fire Nation's advanced technology, and perfects the design of the hot air balloon. In addition, he is both heterodox and resourceful in his endeavors, and a source of comic relief throughout the series. In the sequel series, flashbacks reveal Sokka was the first representative of the Southern Water Tribe to sit on the Republic City Council, and possibly its first chairman. He died a few years after Aang, when the next Avatar, Korra, was still a child.
            </p>
            <h3>Momo</h3>
            <p>
                Momo is the only known Winged Lemur. Momo was introduced when Aang finds him at the Southern Air Temple and then keeps him as a pet. Although Momo has been in many dangerous situations while traveling with the protagonists, he has also been of aid to them and a source of comic relief throughout the series. According to the creators, Momo was intended to represent the spirit of Monk Gyatso, Aang's mentor. Momo is a cross between Bat and a Lemur and is the last of his kind in the show much like Appa. Momo was introduced in the episode "The Southern Air Temple". In the episode, Aang finds Momo at the Southern Air Temple and then keeps him as a pet. After Momo eats a peach, Aang decides to name him Momo, which is Japanese for "peach" and the name of Tibetan dumplings.
            </p>
            <h3>Toph Beifong</h3>
            <p>
                Toph Beifong is a blind Earthbending grandmaster of the prestigious Beifong family in the Earth Kingdom. In the original series, Toph helps Aang master Earthbending. Toph is often sarcastic, direct, and confrontational. Though blind, Toph can feel vibrations in the earth. Through this heightened sense, she can identify people's locations, their distance from her, and their physical build. As another result of her blindness, Toph has acute hearing, enabling her to recognize people by the sound of their voices and to eavesdrop on distant conversations.
                <br><br>Unlike other Earthbenders, Toph has a distinct style of earthbending not based on Hung Gar but on the Southern Praying Mantis, featuring quick generation of energy and low kicks, to suit her small stature. Toph taught herself metalbending by manipulating the metals' impurities at the end of Book Two and throughout Book Three.
            </p>
            <h3>Zuko</h3>
            <p>
                Zuko is the banished prince of the Fire Nation, who ultimately becomes Fire Lord. When exiled, prior to the beginning of the series, by his father Fire Lord Ozai for forfeiting an Agni Kai, Zuko believed that capturing the Avatar would regain his honor. In Book One, Zuko fails many times to capture the Avatar but disguises himself as the Blue Spirit and rescues Aang from Zhao's fortress, and in Book Two, Zuko and his Uncle Iroh earn further displeasure from Ozai and Azula and they are subsequently forced to flee into the Earth Kingdom.
                <br><br>When tempted by his sister Azula's offer of honor's restoration, he betrays his uncle to assist Azula's fight against the Avatar. In Book Three, Zuko eventually rejects his father Ozai's plans and joins Aang. After he learns the secret of Firebending with Aang from two dragons, he becomes Aang's Firebending teacher; helps Sokka rescue prisoners; assists Katara in confronting her mother's killer; and receives his uncle Iroh's forgiveness. After defeating Azula, Zuko becomes the new Fire Lord and ends the war.
            </p>
            <h3>Suki</h3>
            <p>
                Suki is the leader of the exclusively female Kyoshi Warriors. She is an exceptionally skilled fighter, first meeting Team Avatar when they visited her home of Kyoshi Island, where she captured the intruders. She also humiliated Sokka, causing him to change his chauvinistic ways, eventually striking up a friendship as she taught him how to fight. Later in Book Two, she and the Kyoshi Warriors encountered and fought Azula, after which they were defeated and imprisoned. She was liberated by Sokka and Zuko in Book Three, and remained with the protagonists thereafter. Suki joined Toph and Sokka to disable the Fire Nation's air force. She later served with Ty Lee to serve as Zuko's bodyguards after the war ended, reuniting with Sokka on several occasions.
            </p>
            <h3>Uncle Iroh</h3>
            <p>
                Uncle Iroh, also known as General Iroh and "The Dragon of the West", is a Firebending master and former heir to the Fire Nation throne. Unlike most firebenders, Iroh lacks hostility toward other nations and generates his fire and lightning not from fury, as is conventional, but from a sense given to him by dragons, the original source of firebending. Iroh is outwardly easy-going and friendly, and particularly fond of food, good tea the strategy game Pai Sho, cheerful company, and pleasant music. In his old age, he focuses more on relaxation and amusements than on the pursuit of the Avatar, a habit that clashes with the obsessions of his nephew Zuko. 
                <br><br> At the end of the series, after enlisting his fellow White Lotus members to release Ba Sing Se from the Fire Nation's rule, Iroh reopened his tea shop within the city called "The Jasmine Dragon". Iroh is also the namesake of Zuko's grandson.
            </p>
            <h3>Azula</h3>
            <p>
                Azula is Zuko's younger sister and a gifted Firebending master and prodigy, capable of creating blue fire and lightning. After Zhao's death, Azula is sent by Ozai to capture the Avatar, Zuko, and Iroh. Despite her cruel temperament, she becomes distraught when abandoned by her friends Mai and Ty Lee, and collapses mentally when her father leaves her the now-worthless position of Fire Lord, in which she becomes increasingly irrational, paranoid, and mentally unstable, and ultimately suffers a full psychotic breakdown, in which she is overcome by Zuko and Katara. 
                <br><br> Following the end of the war, Azula is placed at a mental institution to be closely monitored. As revealed in the comic sequel, The Search, Azula managed to convince Zuko to let her accompany him in the search for their mother.
