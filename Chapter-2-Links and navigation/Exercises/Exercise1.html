    <h1>Avatar: The Last Airbender</h1>
    <p>
        <b>Avatar: The Last Airbender</b> (abbreviated as <b>ATLA</b>), also known as <b>Avatar: The Legend of Aang</b> in some regions or simply <b>Avatar</b>, is an American animated fantasy action television series created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko and produced by Nickelodeon Animation Studio.
        <br><br> Avatar is set in an Asiatic-inspired world in which some people can telekinetically manipulate one of the four elements—water, earth, fire or air—through practices known as "bending", inspired by Chinese martial arts. The only individual who can bend all four elements, the "Avatar", is responsible for maintaining harmony among the world's four nations, and serves as the link between the physical world and the spirit world.

    <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
    <p>
        A century ago, young <span style="color: rgb(204, 134, 3);">Avatar Aang</span>, afraid of his new responsibilities, fled from his home and was forced into the ocean by a storm. He encased himself and his sky bison Appa in suspended animation in an iceberg near the South Pole. Shortly afterward, Fire Lord Sozin, the ruler of the Fire Nation, launched a world war to expand his nation's empire. Knowing that the Avatar must be an Air Nomad, he carried out a genocide against the Air Nomads with the help of a comet enhancing firebenders' power. A hundred years later, siblings Katara and Sokka, teenagers of the Southern Water Tribe, accidentally discover Aang and revive him.
    </p>

    <div class="sectionthree" id="section3">
        <h2>Characters</h2>
        <h3>Avatar Aang</h3>
        <p>
            Avatar Aang is the protagonist of the original series and the current Avatar, a cyclically reincarnating being who maintains world balance. 
            Aang often acts in a fun-loving, carefree manner. His pacifism and vegetarianism are primary traits of Buddhism. The creators intended Aang to "defeat enemies with his wits" and be a "trickster hero". Though Aang is often frivolous and enthusiastic, he becomes serious during a crisis.
        </p>
        <h3>Appa</h3>
        <p>
            Appa is Aang's male flying bison, animal guide and spirit companion. He is Aang's best friend and serves as the group's mode of transport around the world. He can fly and can use his tail to create powerful gusts of air. According to Aang, flying bisons were the first Airbenders. The show's creators, Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, have described Appa's appearance as a cross between a bison and a manatee. He is known to shed his coat at the end of winter.
        </p>
        <h3>Katara</h3>
        <p>
            Katara is a 14 year-old Waterbending master from the Southern Water Tribe, best friend and later wife of Avatar Aang, and Sokka’s younger sister. In the original series, Katara is known to be very caring and compassionate while also having a strong determination to stand up against systems of oppression and injustice. While she may have been a relatively inexperienced Waterbender at the start of the series, by the end of Book One Katara manages to claim the title of "Waterbending Master" surpassing the skillset of Avatar Aang.
        </p>
        <h3>Sokka</h3>
        <p>
            Sokka is a 15-year-old warrior of the Southern Water Tribe, and Katara's older brother. With no bending power of his own, Sokka relies largely on a metallic boomerang, a blunt metal club, a machete, and later a black jian, or sword, created from the metals of a meteorite.
             Surprisingly in an inhabitant of a mystical world, Sokka is an engineer and something of a jack-of-all-trades, in which respect he is easily able to understand the Fire Nation's advanced technology, and perfects the design of the hot air balloon. In addition, he is both heterodox and resourceful in his endeavors, and a source of comic relief throughout the series.
        </p>
        <h3>Momo</h3>
        <p>
            Momo is the only known Winged Lemur. Momo was introduced when Aang finds him at the Southern Air Temple and then keeps him as a pet. Although Momo has been in many dangerous situations while traveling with the protagonists, he has also been of aid to them and a source of comic relief throughout the series. According to the creators, Momo was intended to represent the spirit of Monk Gyatso, Aang's mentor. Momo is a cross between Bat and a Lemur and is the last of his kind in the show much like Appa. Momo was introduced in the episode "The Southern Air Temple".
        </p>
        <h3>Toph Beifong</h3>
        <p>
            Toph Beifong is a blind Earthbending grandmaster of the prestigious Beifong family in the Earth Kingdom. In the original series, Toph helps Aang master Earthbending. Toph is often sarcastic, direct, and confrontational. Though blind, Toph can feel vibrations in the earth. Through this heightened sense, she can identify people's locations, their distance from her, and their physical build. As another result of her blindness, Toph has acute hearing, enabling her to recognize people by the sound of their voices and to eavesdrop on distant conversations.
        </p>
        <h3>Zuko</h3>
        <p>
            Zuko is the banished prince of the Fire Nation, who ultimately becomes Fire Lord. When exiled, prior to the beginning of the series, by his father Fire Lord Ozai for forfeiting an Agni Kai, Zuko believed that capturing the Avatar would regain his honor. In Book One, Zuko fails many times to capture the Avatar but disguises himself as the Blue Spirit and rescues Aang from Zhao's fortress, and in Book Two, Zuko and his Uncle Iroh earn further displeasure from Ozai and Azula and they are subsequently forced to flee into the Earth Kingdom.
        </p>
        <h3>Suki</h3>
        <p>
            Suki is the leader of the exclusively female Kyoshi Warriors. She is an exceptionally skilled fighter, first meeting Team Avatar when they visited her home of Kyoshi Island, where she captured the intruders. She also humiliated Sokka, causing him to change his chauvinistic ways, eventually striking up a friendship as she taught him how to fight. Later in Book Two, she and the Kyoshi Warriors encountered and fought Azula, after which they were defeated and imprisoned. She was liberated by Sokka and Zuko in Book Three, and remained with the protagonists thereafter. Suki joined Toph and Sokka to disable the Fire Nation's air force.
        </p>
        <h3>Uncle Iroh</h3>
        <p>
            Uncle Iroh, also known as General Iroh and "The Dragon of the West", is a Firebending master and former heir to the Fire Nation throne. Unlike most firebenders, Iroh lacks hostility toward other nations and generates his fire and lightning not from fury, as is conventional, but from a sense given to him by dragons, the original source of firebending. Iroh is outwardly easy-going and friendly, and particularly fond of food, good tea the strategy game Pai Sho, cheerful company, and pleasant music. In his old age, he focuses more on relaxation and amusements than on the pursuit of the Avatar, a habit that clashes with the obsessions of his nephew Zuko.
        </p>
        <h3>Azula</h3>
        <p>
            Azula is Zuko's younger sister and a gifted Firebending master and prodigy, capable of creating blue fire and lightning. After Zhao's death, Azula is sent by Ozai to capture the Avatar, Zuko, and Iroh. Despite her cruel temperament, she becomes distraught when abandoned by her friends Mai and Ty Lee, and collapses mentally when her father leaves her the now-worthless position of Fire Lord, in which she becomes increasingly irrational, paranoid, and mentally unstable, and ultimately suffers a full psychotic breakdown, in which she is overcome by Zuko and Katara.

        <h2>Key Information</h2>
        <p>
            The series addresses many topics rarely touched on in youth entertainment, including issues relating to war, genocide, imperialism, colonialism and totalitarianism, gender discrimination and female empowerment, marginalization and oppression, as well as the philosophical questions surrounding fate, destiny and free will.
            <br><br>The show is set during a period in which the world is engulfed in an imperialistic war initiated by the Fire Nation. While war is a constant backdrop, the show depicts these effects through the eyes of common people—the oppressed Earth Kingdom citizens as well as indoctrinated Fire Nation schoolchildren—to show how war makes victims of everyone.
            <br><br>The show also represents a diverse cast of characters in order to tackle the issue of marginalization. For example, in introducing a blind character like Toph and a paraplegic boy like Teo, the show depicted characters with vulnerabilities overcoming their physical and societal limitations. 
            This is also true when it comes to the show's female characters. For example, female protagonist Katara faces systemic sexism when she reaches the Northern Water Tribe to learn waterbending. In another instance, her brother Sokka is initially dismissive of the all-female Kyoshi Warriors, but learns to respect and appreciate their skills.

            <!--Using span for styling individual words/numbers-->
            <span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">10/10 <br> The best show Nickelodeon has aired</span><br>
            <span style="font-size: 13px;">mjplysaght &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 February, 2017</span>
            <p style="font-size: 16px;">
                OK, so I was 12 when this show came out and needless to say, I was completely enamored by it. For a TV station like Nickelodeon, best known for its wacky shows like SpongeBob, Rocko's Modern Life and their sitcoms like Drake and Josh, to suddenly come out with this anime-inspired animated series with deep philosophical themes as well as tackling genocide and war, this was a massive step forward.
                All the characters are written for and performed expertly, save for maybe some of the guest characters (*cough cough* Jet). My favourite character by far is Zuko. The progression and development of this character is incredible and captures perfectly the transition from villain to antihero to hero. Aang is a good character too, but he's a bit of a goody-two-shoes half the time. Katara and Sokka are equally appealing characters, as well as Toph.
               <br><br>Again, for a children's show to incorporate seriously heavy topics and still have a silly sense of humour is just impressive. I get annoyed every time someone stereotypes this series as just a 'kids show', brushing it off. This show can be watched by someone of any age, and that is one of the reasons I admire it so much. It's not pandering at all and tackles the heavy subject matter in a mature way.

            <p style="font-size: 16px;">This is show is one of the best shows ever created. There are many great lessons in this show that all people (adults and kids) should learn. The show delves into many branches of philosophy, including moral philosophy, that teaches people how to think critically and to always help and understand others. The show has a fantastic plot filled with great comedy and character development. The show has great action scenes as well! I highly recommend this show to everyone!</p>

            <p style="font-size: 16px;">
                This is a anime style cartoon that kids and adults will enjoy watching. It really is one of the best cartoon show I seen in a while, there is little to almost no flaw to this show. I really wished it was longer though, instead of just 3 seasons. It really is a memorable adventure, which has many elements that will keep your attention from beginning to end. Plus just about every characters in this show is memorable and not just the main characters either, and for a bunch of cartoon characters I actually cared about what happens to them. One of the best animated series I seen, and I highly recommend anyone that enjoys a good story in a cartoon to watch this amazing show.

            <span style="font-size: 13px;">A_Different_Drummer &nbsp; &nbsp; 18 September, 2018</span>
            <p style="font-size: 16px;">
                When I first watched this series I made the same "mistake" most reviewers do when reviewing anything for the first time. As good as it was, I "assumed" that over time something better would appear. But that never happened.
                So after 10 years I have given up. I just rewatched the whole series top to bottom and currently have a nice endorphin buzz going because this astonishing series just gets better as you go, and the final episode just plants a big smile on your face.
                <br>Perfect writing, direction, story, dialog, animation, characters. And all with a chewy moral center.
