                <span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">10/10 <br> The best show Nickelodeon has aired</span><br>

                    OK, so I was 12 when this show came out and needless to say, I was completely enamored by it. For a TV station like Nickelodeon, best known for its wacky shows like SpongeBob, Rocko's Modern Life and their sitcoms like Drake and Josh, to suddenly come out with this anime-inspired animated series with deep philosophical themes as well as tackling genocide and war, this was a massive step forward.
                    All the characters are written for and performed expertly, save for maybe some of the guest characters (*cough cough* Jet). My favourite character by far is Zuko. The progression and development of this character is incredible and captures perfectly the transition from villain to antihero to hero. Aang is a good character too, but he's a bit of a goody-two-shoes half the time. Katara and Sokka are equally appealing characters, as well as Toph.
                   <br><br>Again, for a children's show to incorporate seriously heavy topics and still have a silly sense of humour is just impressive. I get annoyed every time someone stereotypes this series as just a 'kids show', brushing it off. This show can be watched by someone of any age, and that is one of the reasons I admire it so much. It's not pandering at all and tackles the heavy subject matter in a mature way.

                <span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">10/10 <br> Great show with fantastic messages, lessons, philosophical discussions, character development, plots and comedy</span><br>

                <p style="font-size: 16px;">This is show is one of the best shows ever created. There are many great lessons in this show that all people (adults and kids) should learn. The show delves into many branches of philosophy, including moral philosophy, that teaches people how to think critically and to always help and understand others. The show has a fantastic plot filled with great comedy and character development. The show has great action scenes as well! I highly recommend this show to everyone!</p>

                <span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">9/10 <br> One of the best animated shows I've seen </span><br>

                    This is a anime style cartoon that kids and adults will enjoy watching. It really is one of the best cartoon show I seen in a while, there is little to almost no flaw to this show. I really wished it was longer though, instead of just 3 seasons. It really is a memorable adventure, which has many elements that will keep your attention from beginning to end. Plus just about every characters in this show is memorable and not just the main characters either, and for a bunch of cartoon characters I actually cared about what happens to them. One of the best animated series I seen, and I highly recommend anyone that enjoys a good story in a cartoon to watch this amazing show.

                <span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">10/10 <br> I just rewatched the best TV series in the history of the world </span><br>
                <span style="font-size: 13px;">A_Different_Drummer &nbsp; &nbsp; 18 September, 2018</span>

                    When I first watched this series I made the same "mistake" most reviewers do when reviewing anything for the first time. As good as it was, I "assumed" that over time something better would appear. But that never happened.
                    So after 10 years I have given up. I just rewatched the whole series top to bottom and currently have a nice endorphin buzz going because this astonishing series just gets better as you go, and the final episode just plants a big smile on your face.
                    <br>Perfect writing, direction, story, dialog, animation, characters. And all with a chewy moral center.
