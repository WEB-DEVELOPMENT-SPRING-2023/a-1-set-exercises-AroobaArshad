        Everyone needs to know how to make a classic grilled cheese sandwich. A grilled cheese (sometimes known as a toasted sandwich or cheese toastie) is a hot sandwich typically prepared by heating one or more slices of cheese between slices of bread, with a cooking fat such as butter, on a frying pan, griddle, or sandwich toaster, until the bread browns and the cheese melts. The sandwich is typically served as a snack or lunchtime meal, often with a side of salad, soup, french fries, or other accompaniment.

    <h2>
        Best Bread for Grilled Cheese
    </h2>
    <p>
        This recipe calls for plain white sandwich bread. You could also use sourdough, brioche, or even ciabatta. You can really make grilled cheese with any type of bread you like, but you should make sure the loaf is sturdy enough to handle the heat. Thinly sliced, delicate breads will quickly fall apart.

    <h2>
        What cheese is the best for grilled cheese ?
    </h2>
    <p>
        A grilled cheese is only as good as the cheese used for it. You want to make sure you're using a melty cheese like American, cheddar, pepper jack, havarti, gruyere, and Monterey Jack. Look for low moisture cheese when picking as they melt the best. Shredded cheese will also melt more quickly than a slices and create a better cheese pull for optimal effect. Just make sure to shred the cheese yourself rather than buying pre-shredded cheese. Pre-shredded has additives to keep it from melting so it's not ideal for your best grilled cheese.
